# Timing Circuit Design portfolio

This repository contains all the homeworks I completed during my **Timing Circuit Design and Application** course in 2025. The topics include combinational circuit design, sequential circuit design, finite state machine (FSM), synthesis, and APR.

We used **Verilog** throughout the course. The main tools employed were **Synopsys VCS** for simulation, **Synopsys DC** for synthesis, **Cadence Innovus** for APR, and **nWave** from **Verdi** for waveform debugging. 

## 🔸 Lab List

- **Lab1** – Design and verification of the message schedule module in a hash algorithm
- **Lab2** – Design and verification of the complete hash algorithm
- **Lab3** – FPGA prototyping of the hash algorithm

In the reports of the labs, there are block diagram, module structure, FSM flow char and waveform by wavedrom. Also note that all design RTL code and testbench including testcase are designed by myself.
