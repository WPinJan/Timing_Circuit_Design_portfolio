# Timing Circuit Design portfolio

This repository contains all the homeworks I completed during my **Timing Circuit Design and Application** course in 2025. The topics include Tunable Delay Line (TDL), Delay Locked Loop (DLL), Phase Locked Loop (PLL), Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC), Digital-to-Time Converter (DTC), Duty Cycle Corrector (DCC) and some introduction of delay monitoring and built-in self-repair for interconnects in 3D ICs.

We get familiar with cell based design flow in the homeworks. We used **Verilog** throughout the course. The main tools employed were **Synopsys VCS** for simulation, **Synopsys DC** for synthesis, **Cadence Innovus** for APR, and **nWave** from **Verdi** for waveform debugging and verification. 

## 🔸 Homework List

- **HW1** – Design of the successive approximation algorithm
- **HW2** – Design of a low resolution Phase Locked Loop (PLL)
- **HW3** – Design of a low resolution Duty Cycle Corrector (DCC)

In the reports of the homeworks, there are block diagram, module structure and FSM flow chart. Homeworks include rtl simulation, gate level simulation and post-layout simulation.
